In the first panel, also change the orientation to vertical and transfer our properties to look like this: </p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>In the lower panel, add two buttons, set their padding as on the \"Add a new car\" button and name them accordingly: \"Add a new car\" and \"Back to all cars\". </p> <p>In the settings for the \"Back to all cars\" button, set the \"Actions\" to \"Open page\" \"Main page\". Clicking this button will redirect the user to the page with the data grid. For the \"Add a new car\" button, create a data flow, which we will link to it later.</p> <p>The data flow will consist of the following steps: <code>get action model</code>, <code>execute script</code>, <code>update entry</code>, <code>write response</code>. Let's configure them. </p> <p>In the <code>execute script</code> step, create variables that will be used for the properties <code>is_manager_exists</code> and <code>is_archieved</code>:</p> Text Only<pre><code>item[\"_is_manager_exists@boolean\"] = False\nitem[\"_is_archieved@boolean\"] = False\n</code></pre> <p>Next, configure the <code>Update entry</code> step:</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Next, we need to map our fields. Remember that the fields in the step settings are mapped with the prefix data.<code>property_name</code>. For the properties <code>is_archieved</code> and <code>is_manager_exists</code>, use the variable values set in the execute script step, leave the <code>chosen_manager</code> field empty:</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Always set the source step for each step except the first one. This will not be mentioned further in the tutorial description.</p> <p>Now that our data flow is complete, we can link it to the \"Add a new car\" button and save our component.

It is designed for a single function - assigning a manager to a particular car. Let's move on to setting up the workspace.</p> <p>The page itself will resemble the \"Add a new car\" page, with the only difference being that we will add the <code>chosen_manager</code> property to the workspace, which will be the only property available for modification. This allows the manager to select a colleague to whom they will transfer the car and the deal. Also, add two buttons, one to close the modal window called \"Back to all cars\", and the other called \"Appoint a manager\" which will be linked to a data flow that we will create later.</p> <p>Don't forget to enable the Disabled setting in the TextBox settings for each property except <code>chosen_manager</code>.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>The final result on this page should look like the one shown below:</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Let's move on to configuring the data flow. </p> <p>We need to add the following steps: <code>get action model</code>, <code>execute script</code>, <code>lookup reference</code>, <code>update entry</code>, <code>write response</code>. </p> <p>In the <code>execute script</code> step, we will create a variable that will change the <code>is_manager_exists</code> property to True, causing the newly created entry to disappear from the data grid on the Main page, where we have set static filters. </p> Text Only<pre><code>item[\"_is_manager_exists@boolean\"] = True\n</code></pre> <p>Next, we use the <code>Lookup reference</code> step.

Here we leave all fields empty except for <code>is_archieved</code>.
