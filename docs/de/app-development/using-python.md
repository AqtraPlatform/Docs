# Using Python


## Introduction

The platform provides the ability to use Python for various purposes, due to its convenience and wide adoption as a scripting and programming language. Python scripts on the platform must comply with version 3.0 as described in [official Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/). The full Developer's Guide is available in [Python Developer's Guide](https://docs.python.org/3/).

Python on the platform is called IronPython, which enables interaction with C# code. It includes two main libraries - `clr` and `system`, which provide access to platform entities.

## Python Library Menu

In this menu, you can add common Python modules that become available on the front-end (in Component Script) and on the back-end (in the Execute Script step for dataflow).

### Viewing Common Python Modules

The Python Modules Menu displays a list of modules that have already been added, including information about whether the module is available for front-end, back-end, or both.
