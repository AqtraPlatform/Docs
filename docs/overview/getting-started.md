## Access to Studio

### Log in to Studio

To access Studio, use the link in the format `/studio/` appended to the address of your deployed platform instance. For example, if the platform is deployed on `mydomain.io`, you need to go to `https://mydomain.io/studio/` to log in to Studio.

When you do this, you will see a login screen. To log in to Studio, enter your credentials — username and password. After logging in, you will be redirected to the main page.
