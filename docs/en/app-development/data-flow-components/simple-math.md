## General information
The “Simple Math” step is used to perform simple mathematical operations on string data. This step allows you to select two fields from the data model and apply one of the specified mathematical operations to them, and then write the result to the third field of the model.

## Parameters
**Step Settings:**

| Setting Field | Value Options    | Purpose |
|----------------|----------------------|------------|
| Step name      | -                    | Name of the step |
| Source step    | Multiselect of Catalog | Selecting the previous step |
| Add Operation  | +, -, \*, /, AND, OR, XOR | Operations to perform on the selected fields |

## Cases
- **Mathematical Data Processing**: Used to perform basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as logical operations.
- **Data Aggregation and Modification**: Suitable for changing values in a data model by aggregating or modifying the source data using simple calculations.

## Exceptions
- **Accuracy of Field and Operation Selection**: Fields and operations must be precisely selected to achieve the expected result.
